## Description

___

The project is a user-centric platform constructed with the MERN-stack single-page application architecture. It leverages MongoDB as its backend, GraphQL API for efficient data querying and manipulation, and an Express.js and Node.js server for handling server-side operations. On the frontend, it employs React to deliver a seamless user interface, ensuring smooth and intuitive interaction.

One of its notable features is the incorporation of user authentication through JSON Web Tokens (JWT), guaranteeing secure access to user accounts while preventing unauthorized entry. This authentication mechanism enables users to create accounts, log in, and perform actions tailored to their specific permissions.

This is a still a work in progress and over time will incorporate our may ideas.  Stay Tuned!!
